# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with .NET

This repository provides an implementation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles using .NET framework. The aim is to demonstrate how DDD can be applied in building robust, maintainable, and scalable software solutions.

Please keep in mind that this repository serves as a boilerplate for architecture. It provides a foundation for building your application using the specified architecture. You have the flexibility to add additional domain services or domain events in the domain layer as per your specific requirements. Feel free to customize and extend the architecture based on your project needs.

You can explore another architecture in this [Onion Architecture](https://github.com/amirhosseinsaloot/dotnet-vue/tree/clean-max3aggregates) repository. This repository showcases an implementation that includes unit tests and integration tests. It also provides a sample for the front end using Vue.js.

## Introduction to DDD

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that focuses on modeling the problem domain and aligning it closely with the software implementation. The key principles of DDD include:

- **Ubiquitous Language**: Creating a common, shared language between domain experts and developers to ensure a clear understanding of the problem domain.
- **Bounded Context**: Defining clear boundaries within the domain to establish context-specific models and concepts.
- **Aggregates**: Designing aggregates as consistency boundaries that encapsulate and enforce the integrity of related entities and value objects.
- **Domain Events**: Capturing and representing domain events as first-class citizens to enable better communication and synchronization between bounded contexts.
- **Repositories**: Implementing repositories to provide a clean interface for accessing and persisting domain objects.
- **Application Services**: Defining application services as the entry points for interacting with the domain layer.

This repository showcases the practical implementation of these DDD principles using .NET.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main layers:

- **Api**: Contains the presentation layer of the application, including API controllers, routes, and any other components related to the user interface or API endpoints.
- **Infrastructure**: Provides infrastructure-related services and implementations that support the application, such as data access, external integrations, logging, and caching.
- **Domain**: Represents the core domain models, entities, aggregates, value objects, and domain services.

The folder structure is organized in a modular manner, emphasizing separation of concerns and ease of maintenance.

Within each layer, additional subfolders and modules may be created based on the specific needs of the application. This structure enables clear separation of responsibilities and facilitates scalability and maintainability of the codebase.

## Domain Layer

The domain layer is the heart of the application and represents the problem domain. It includes the following components:

- **Entities**: Represent business objects that have unique identities and encapsulate behavior.
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects that represent concepts within the domain and are solely defined by their attributes.
- **Aggregates**: Consistency boundaries that encapsulate and manage the lifecycle of related entities and value objects.
- **Domain Services**: Contain domain-specific logic that doesn't fit within the boundaries of a single entity or value object.

## Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer handles external dependencies and technical implementations. It includes:

- **Repositories**: Abstract interfaces and implementations for accessing and persisting domain objects.
- **Database Context**: Defines the database schema and provides a way to query and persist data.
- **Repositories**: Implements the interfaces defined in the domain layer, providing data access and storage functionality.


## Presentation Layer
In this repository,I merged Presentation layer with Application Layer.
The application layer acts as a bridge between the presentation and domain layers. 
The presentation layer is responsible for the user interface or APIs through which users interact with the application.
They consist of:

- **Application Services**: Provide high-level operations and orchestrate the interaction with the domain layer. They are responsible for handling use cases and coordinating domain objects.
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Plain data structures used to transfer data between the presentation and application layers.
- **API Controllers**: Implement RESTful APIs for client-server communication.
