## Database Configuration
* Database provider :

    You can use SqlServer or PostgreSql in this template by update DatabaseProvider in **Api/appsettings.json** 
    ```json
      "DatabaseProvider": 1 /* Postgres = 1 , SqlServer = 2 */
    ```
    Then update ConnectionString 
    ```json
     "ConnectionStrings": {
        "SqlServer": "Server=.;Database=TestDb;User Id=YourDatabaseId;Password=YourDatabasePassword",
        "Postgres": "Host=localhost;Database=TestDb;Username=YourDatabaseUsername;Password=YourDatabasePassword"
      },
    ```

* Files Storing :
    There are two ways for storing files in this template :
    1. Store in Database
    2. Store in files

    ```json
      "StoreFilesOnDatabase": false,
    ```

## Backend Architecture Overview

The backend of this project incorporates some principles of domain-driven design (DDD), although not all of them. It aligns more closely with the clean architecture approach. However, there may be instances of code smell present, such as the direct usage of AutoMapper in the repository, which is referred to as the DataProvider. This decision was made to leverage the performance benefits of projection.

Please note that this implementation is suitable for a maximum of three aggregates and may not be ideal for more complex projects. It is recommended for those who have limited knowledge of C# and .NET.

If you are looking for an example of domain-driven design, I recommend exploring the [DDD Example](https://github.com/amirhosseinsaloot/dotnet-vue) repository. This repository showcases a complete implementation of DDD and can serve as a valuable resource for understanding and implementing domain-driven design in a more complex project.

### Domain Layer
This will contains Enums , Exception classes , Interfaces (The Interfaces of generic repositories) and Abstractions (Implementions on above layers) , Setting classes , Entities , POCO classes, construction, and model validation , and Utilities will be used in above layers .

### Infrastructure Layer
This layer contains Entities , Database config , Migrations , DataProviders (Presentation layer uses DataProviders for getting proper data) and application services such as Domain services (Business logic) or other services like Email , Sms and etc.

### Presentation Layer (Backend API)

Api endpoints , Middlewares , FilterActions , Service Registrations are placed in this layer.
In addition, this layer depends on Infrastructure layer.

## Frontend Overview
